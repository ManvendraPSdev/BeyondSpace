# AWS Migration Guide for Metaverse Project

This guide outlines how to implement the current project components using AWS services.

## Current Architecture Overview
The project consists of the following main components:
- Frontend (React/TypeScript application)
- HTTP Server (REST API)
- WebSocket Server
- Database Layer
- Static File Storage

## AWS Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Frontend Deployment
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**
  - Deploy the React frontend to Amazon S3 static website hosting
  - Use CloudFront as CDN for global content delivery
  - Configure custom domain using Route 53
  - Setup SSL/TLS certificates using AWS Certificate Manager

### 2. HTTP Server (REST API)
- **AWS API Gateway + Lambda**
  - Migrate REST endpoints to API Gateway
  - Implement backend logic in Lambda functions
  - Use Lambda layers for shared code
  - Configure API Gateway with custom domain
  - Use AWS Lambda function URLs for direct function access

### 3. WebSocket Server
- **AWS API Gateway WebSocket APIs**
  - Migrate WebSocket functionality to API Gateway WebSocket APIs
  - Use Lambda functions for connection handling
  - Implement room management using DynamoDB for connection tracking
  - Use AWS IoT Core as alternative for real-time communication

### 4. Database
- **Amazon RDS + DynamoDB**
  - Migrate Prisma schema to Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
  - Use DynamoDB for real-time data (session management, room states)
  - Implement read replicas for scalability
  - Use AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials

### 5. Static File Storage
- **Amazon S3**
  - Store user avatars and static assets in S3 buckets
  - Implement pre-signed URLs for secure file uploads
  - Use S3 lifecycle policies for object management
  - Configure CORS policies for frontend access

### 6. Authentication & Authorization
- **Amazon Cognito**
  - Implement user authentication using Cognito User Pools
  - Use Cognito Identity Pools for AWS service access
  - Integrate with existing authentication flow
  - Configure social identity providers if needed

### 7. Additional AWS Services to Consider
- **Amazon ElastiCache**
  - For session management and caching
- **Amazon SQS/SNS**
  - For asynchronous message processing
- **AWS WAF**
  - For web application security
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - For monitoring and logging
- **AWS Lambda@Edge**
  - For edge computing requirements

### 8. Infrastructure as Code
- Use AWS CDK or CloudFormation to define infrastructure
- Implement separate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Setup CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline

### 9. Security Considerations
- Implement IAM roles and policies
- Use VPC for network isolation
- Enable AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- Configure AWS KMS for encryption

### 10. Cost Optimization
- Implement auto-scaling policies
- Use reserved instances where applicable
- Monitor usage with AWS Cost Explorer
- Set up billing alarms

## Migration Strategy
1. Start with static frontend migration to S3/CloudFront
2. Implement API Gateway + Lambda for HTTP endpoints
3. Migrate WebSocket functionality
4. Setup database infrastructure
5. Configure authentication with Cognito
6. Implement remaining services
7. Test thoroughly in staging environment
8. Plan production cutover

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Setup CloudWatch dashboards
- Configure alarms and notifications
- Implement backup strategies
- Plan for disaster recovery

This migration will provide improved scalability, reliability, and security while potentially reducing operational overhead through managed services.
